Understanding and managing user personas is not an easy thing within Intune. While there’s no silver bullet, I would highly recommend you look at a feature from [Robopack](https://robopack.com/) called `Patch Groups`.

Imagine not only being able to group your apps together for assignment, but also deploy them in waves. That goes a long way towards making persona management a reality.
