This week we took a big detour from our usual topics and dove into Mac management with Intune. That and our second podcast episode wraps things up for this week.

How to Enroll a Mac to Intune
-----------------------------

Get familiar with the basic steps for getting a Mac enrolled in Intune via the Company Portal. No fancy zero touch provisioning yet, just basic enrollment and configuration.

Head over here to grab the Intune Company Portal app for Mac to get started:

How to Deploy Mac Apps with Intune
----------------------------------

Now that the Mac is enrolled, let’s push some apps to it. We go over several ways to do this including

-   .pkg Line-of-business apps
    
-   .DMG apps
    
-   Microsoft 365 apps config (Office 365)
    
-   Shell scripting to deploy apps
    

Microsoft has some great examples for shell scripting to get you started if you’re new to it.

GETRUBIX PODCAST - Episode 2: Defender for Endpoint
---------------------------------------------------

Microsoft security is becoming a hot topic and the 365 Defender suite can be a crazy and intimidating labyrinth to navigate.

So I brought on a good friend who I’m proud to have work on my team, Derrick Ferrell, who spends his days as a Microsoft Security Architect. Derrick joined us and shared his thoughts on the Microsoft Defender ecosystem as a whole and then spent some time going into the weeds of Defender for Endpoint.

Until next week…

This is the second to last weekend for holiday shopping, so get out there in those malls, but come back starting Monday when we get right back into it with new vids and Episode 3 of the podcast!
