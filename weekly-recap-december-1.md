After being inspired by [Andrew Taylor’s weekly Intune newsletter](https://andrewstaylor.com/2023/12/01/intune-newsletter-1st-december-2023/) (which now includes me for some reason), I figured it would make sense to start providing a summary of my videos every Friday. This will give me a chance to add some context, helpful links, and address some questions that may have come up throughout the week.

Moving an Intune Tenant
-----------------------

My team has been long time users of [Mikael Karlsson’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikael-karlsson-66154326/) Intune Management PowerShell tool, which you can grab [here from GitHub](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement). It’s incredibly useful for documenting your Intune tenant.

Now that we’re (obviously) in the weeds of migrating devices with Intune, it makes sense to talk about migrating the _actual_ Intune tenant, and this management tool does an amazing job of exporting configs from one environment and importing into another.

Intune Custom Compliance
------------------------

The ability to create custom compliance policies within Intune is one of the best kept secrets of the platform.

It can be a bit tricky to get started between the two types of scripts that are used, but I posted the samples I used in the video [here in the GitHub](https://github.com/stevecapacity/IntunePowershell) to make things easier.

Intune Device Migration V3
--------------------------

The original user experience was the first thing I showed a few months ago. Since then there have been so many new members to the community that it made sense to record an updated walkthrough.

I will be releasing the V3 code on GitHub by mid-next week, but here is a snippet from the README.md in advance:

> Intune tenant-to-tenant device migration V3 adds the capability of operating off of one, settings file that is modified so that the solution code can remain untouched.

> The migration solution offers two paths:
> 
> -   **User data migration**: To migrate user data during migration, start by deploying the _PreMigrate_ script prior to running the full migration package
> -   **No user data migration**: If user data does not need to be migrated (perhaps you're utilizing OneDrive for that), you can start the process with the migration package at the start _StartMigrate_ script. This can automatically detect if the _PreMigrate_ script has been run and proceed accordingly.

### Thank you

That does it for this week. I want to thank the entire GetRubix community, as we’re now over **80 users** in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/getrubix). If you’re not already in there, feel free to stop by and say hi.
