Time for something a bit different. You see, I’ve been helping several organizations over the last few weeks test Windows 11 enrollments to Intune via Autopilot. I’ve come across a few things that are particularly interesting.

“You’re just talking about Windows again, Steve… what’s _different_?” Glad you asked. Instead of just typing about the experience, I thought it would be better for all of us if I just show you. So with that, we’re really excited to introduce you to the official Get Rubix Youtube channel. And with it, here is our first upload, where I take you through a Windows 11 enrollment.
