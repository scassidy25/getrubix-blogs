First week of 2024 complete. Thanks to everyone who pushed our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@getrubix9986) to over 500 subscribers!

How to Customize Windows 11 with Intune and Autopilot
-----------------------------------------------------

Adding advertisements was a lot of fun, even if they’re fake. This is an overview of a few helpful customizations between Intune and Autopilot that will help tweak Windows 11 to make it easier to adopt for most users.

How to Automate Intune App Packaging with Winget
------------------------------------------------

The taco character is growing on me. Taking app packaging in a different direction than chocolatey, we looked at [Stephen van Rooij](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanvanrooij/)’s custom tool for grabbing Winget applications and posting them directly to Intune. Very cool and easy to use [solution](https://github.com/svrooij/wingetintune) (even if I didn’t use the latest one in the video…)

GETRUBIX PODCAST - Episode 5: Intune from the Beginning
-------------------------------------------------------

If you’ve been reading this blog through the years, then you already know [Jesse Weimer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-weimer-037a443b/), as he’s contributed quite a bit. I would’ve preferred to have him on a much earlier episode, but he decided to get Covid and then go to Disney World. Either way, we had a great conversation about how things were in the early days of Intune and the evolution through the years.

Stay tuned…

As always, there’s a lot more to come so keep checking back and feel free to hop in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/getrubix) server. Hopefully we’ll have another AMA/Livestream happening very soon.
