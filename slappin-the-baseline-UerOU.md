Security Baselines… gotta love them. Well maybe not - I personally recommend breaking them out into Settings Catalog profiles; especially when you have a mix of other configuration profiles already in the mix (otherwise you may encounter some conflicts).

However if you’re trying to see what policies Microsoft recommends, or if you are generally starting fresh with Windows device management in Intune, then the Baselines are a great starting point.  

### **HoloLens… is that you?**

Recently Microsoft announced that security baselines were in development for HoloLens 2 devices, and it looks like they made their way to Intune:

Interestingly, Microsoft has not created a dedicated page yet with all of the [baseline settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/security-baselines). Also, I’m curious as to why Microsoft added this now since they recently announced the discontinuation of the HoloLens 2. The good news though is update support will continue through December 31, 2027, which means I can still test this thing for a while!

Now that’s a happy camper. Since there’s no official list yet of all the policies, I went ahead and looked through the Standard and Advanced lists and typed them all up below.

Not too shabby. I guess just be careful and review any current profiles prior to testing, especially around password, WHfB, and Windows Updates. If you’re using Update Rings currently, you should generally be ok if you’re not using an insider/dev channel. Here’s the bigger baseline:

And that’s it. If you’re curious about what other Windows policies are supported for HoloLens 2 devices, take a peak at this additional Microsoft link: [Policies in Policy CSP supported by HoloLens 2 | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policies-in-policy-csp-supported-by-hololens2). Don’t forget that Autopilot registration procedures are [available here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens2-autopilot#obtain-hardware-hash), as well as this helpful platform guide that combines the points above: [Use Windows Holographic devices with Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/windows-holographic-for-business).
