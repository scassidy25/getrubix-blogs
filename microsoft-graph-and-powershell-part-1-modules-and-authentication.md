I don’t know about you, but this one has a great title; lot of words.

One of the most efficient ways to work with the Microsoft 365 platform is via the graph API. if you’re not familiar, go take care of that now:

https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer

It’s super easy to get started, and there’s a lot of great documentation. That is, until you veer off the standard path.

In my world, we’re constantly looking for ways to automate components with Azure AD, Intune and Autopilot. And the best way to do this is with PowerShell scripting via the Microsoft Graph. But how do we get started with that? I’m glad you asked.

We’re going to be doing a multi-part series with everything from getting the right modules to authentication to automating tasks you would normally spend time clicking around the console.

In this first part, we take you through how to import the dedicated PowerShell modules required and using that to authenticate.
