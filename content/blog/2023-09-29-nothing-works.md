In the tech world, we like to pretend troubleshooting is a last resort. It’s comforting to perceive that operating systems function most of the time, cloud solutions always run because they’re hosted, and scripts you find from bald guys with red glasses on the internet work without a hitch. But unfortunately, we all know better.

There’s always problems with technical solutions, and our Intune Tenant to Tenant Device Migration is no different, as much as I’d like it to be. Thankfully, like most IT professionals, we are forced to become very proficient in the art of troubleshooting.

Let me just say that I’m beyond thrilled that folks are out there testing the migration solution, so much so that I’m receiving tons of feedback daily, and with that, tons of issues. So how are we going to address them?

We’re going to be adding a **Troubleshooting** series to our [GetRubix YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@getrubix9986) channel where I walk through different issues starting with the migration solution, and then ultimately opening up to broader Intune and Autopilot topics. The [first episode is already up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27mbZPUb6Fc) and tackles a major issue so check it out.

Next, we wanted to offer a place for all GetRubix followers to get in touch with us a lot easier to discuss solutions, position challenges, troubleshoot issues together, and just share knowledge and war stories from the modern workplace field. So we’re introducing the official [**GetRubix Discord** server](https://discord.gg/getrubix), so please feel free to come on in.
