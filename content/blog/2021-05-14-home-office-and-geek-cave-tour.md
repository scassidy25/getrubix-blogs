This post is a bit different than the rest, as I won’t be talking about any scripts or policy configuration.  Many have asked me about the tools I use on a daily basis and how I configure my home (basement) office.  So, to commemorate the 14 months since I’ve gone full time remote, I’d like to detail my setup and shed some light on why some things are the way they are.

### **Computers**

Because I implement modern management environments for a living, I’m always surrounded by computers.  There was a time when I was exclusively an Apple Mac user, but the decline in their quality combined with the amount of my time needed to be spent in Windows pushed me to the other side.  I like being in Windows 10, and it keeps getting better.  I have been exclusively using the Microsoft Surface line since about 2015.  Currently I’m using a Surface Laptop 4 AMD edition as my daily driver.  This year alone I’ve used the Surface Book 3, Surface Pro 7+ and even the Laptop Go.  It’s a consistent line and offers PC users something Mac always had over them, hardware software integration. 

The Surface Laptop is connected to the Surface Dock 2, which also powers a Dell D6000 USB dock, which is the secret to squeezing out three or more displays.

### **Servers**

There are three Hyper-V servers running on my home network that sit on an assortment of hardware.One of these, is about one of the coolest desktop PCs I’ve ever owned; the Intel NUC 8, similar to [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-NUC-NUC8I7HNK-Gaming-Mini/dp/B07WGYJJWB/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=intel%20nuc%208&qid=1621018053&sr=8-10).

Not sure why it has a light up skull, but I’m not complaining.

The servers all have 64gb RAM and 4TB of SSD storage.  I use [Royal TS](https://www.royalapps.com/ts/win/features) server and client to access everything.  Royal TS has been great for me, as I can run individual Hyper-V sessions without having to RDP into the whole server.  It also has a simple server gateway included which lets me access my machines from outside the house, even if that’s pretty rare these days.

### **Monitors**

Some folks get freaked out when they see how many monitors I use.  Personally, I’ve seen crazier setups out there, but I’m still flattered.  It helps when I explain what they’re all for, besides from pretending I run the Matrix.

![20210514_145641.jpg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd365a31aa1fd743bc30b8e/1621027449410-N0SD457Q9LH6BYGFS2VA/20210514_145641.jpg)

The main display, front and center is for production work. It’s the primary display and the one I stare at the most. Typically, it’s the largest in the bunch and has a high resolution and fantastic panel. At the time of writing, it is a LG 32” QHD IPS display. It’s got HDR colors, 165hz motion and perfect IPS so the viewing angle looks good all around. Plus, it’s branded as a gaming display, so it has a sick aesthetic.

The vertical display on my right is a Dell 27” Ultra-sharp QHD and used exclusively for Microsoft Teams.  Teams is where I _live_ when I work.  I chat with co-workers, host meetings with customers, share projects with our dev team, etc.  It rightfully deserves its own display.

Above the primary 32” monitor, sits a 24” LG 1080p display.  This one is dedicated to screen sharing on customer calls and presentations.  I’m often asked why I feel the need to dedicate a display solely for this purpose, but if you find yourself screen sharing for a good part of your workday, consider the following:

![20210514_171154.jpg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd365a31aa1fd743bc30b8e/1621027533932-26QZLX1OSO5ADXC0UKHN/20210514_171154.jpg)

-   Having a dedicated screen for sharing means my mail, chat, browser and calendar programs are never in the way.  I can leave these running on the production monitor without worrying about sharing sensitive information. 
    
-   Windows notifications can remain on without worrying about any “do not disturb” settings.
    
-   This is a 1080p display on purpose.  High-res and widescreen monitors do not scale well when screen sharing, and people will often have a hard time seeing content.  1080p at this size maintains 100% scaling so the content I’m sharing is always at a comfortable viewing size.
    

One more thought about the monitors is how they’re connected.  This part seems to confuse people, which is weird because modern hardware makes this an easy setup.  The Surface Laptop is connected to a Surface Dock, which offers ports for two displays.  Coming out of one of the USB ports on that dock is a Dell D6000 dock that offers up to three additional display outputs using [DisplayLink](https://www.displaylink.com/) software.  So while I’m at three now, I would have no problem driving an additional monitor or two.

Maybe the laptop display itself counts, but that’s more that I don’t like running notebooks in “clamshell” mode.  So, I dedicate the small screen to my email client, as I’m trying to not check email so much throughout the day.

### **Other stuff**

Here are some quick notes on some of the random things on my desk:

-   Google Nest 2: a glorified, connected clock that also tells me the temperature outside
    
-   Logitech G915 TKL mechanical keyboard: I prefer keyboards without the number pad and this one has a great feel without being too loud
    
-   Logitech Stream Cam: so folks can see me in 1080p on video chat.  Will also come in handy if I ever get around to doing YouTube videos.
    
-   Logitech MX Master Mouse 2: Best mouse ever
    
-   Elgato Key Light: Lights up my face on video chats and is controlled over WIFI.
    
-   Surface Headphones 2: Comfy enough to wear all day and they have awesome battery life.
    
-   Funko Pops: Couldn’t get through the day without these tiny representations of all my favorite characters from just about every genre I’m interested in.
    

That’s all.  Thanks for taking the tour with me.  I’ll leave you with a view of the shelf behind me that acts as the ultimate backdrop for IT professionals:
