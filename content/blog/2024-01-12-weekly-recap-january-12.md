This week, I squeezed in one extra video AND wound up as a guest on the [We Got Your Mac](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDTrGbF9OINBQ146kWfqL6A) podcast. Not bad.

How to Quickly Create Hyper-V Machines: Part 1
----------------------------------------------

For about three years, I’ve been using an [automated solution](https://www.getrubix.com/blog/hyped-up-hyper-v) to generate Hyper-V virtual machines on the fly to help me test Intune and Autopilot enrollments. I finally decided to break down how I do it.

Part 1 looks at the PowerShell script I use. Grab it on [GitHub here](https://github.com/stevecapacity/IntunePowershell/blob/main/createHyperV.ps1).

How to Quickly Create Hyper-V Machines: Part 2
----------------------------------------------

In Part 2, we walk through creating the virtual disk image that will be used for our on-demand virtual machines.

How to Quickly Create Hyper-V Machines: Part 3
----------------------------------------------

In Part 3, we put it all together and walk through how the script uses the virtual disk image to quickly create a Hyper-V virtual machine that’s ready for Autopilot.

GETRUBIX PODCAST - Episode **6**: WDAC - The New Applocker
----------------------------------------------------------

In today's episode of the GetRubix podcast, we're joined by [Craig Ranger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-ranger-885687227/), Microsoft Solutions Architect. Craig is going to take us on a tour of Windows Defender Application Control, which is the successor to Applocker.

BONUS - We Got Your Mac: Episode 9
----------------------------------

This week I was a guest on the We Got Your Mac podcast, which talks about issues helping organizations adopt Mac into their environment. Apparently I know some things about Mac and unified endpoint management, so they had me on.

That pic with the scraps of side-hair though…

Stay tuned…
