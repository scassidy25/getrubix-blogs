## How to onboard Macs to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
---

As soon as I started putting up some Mac based videos, there were immediately questions regarding Macs and Defender for Endpoint. It’s going to be a lot more common in 2024 as Defender is a great, unified security tool.

While not as simple to onboard as the PCs, I created an easy to follow guide so you can take an Intune managed Mac and bring it to Defender for Endpoint.
