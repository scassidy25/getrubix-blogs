Time to close out 2023.

How to onboard PCs to Defender for Endpoint with Intune
-------------------------------------------------------

We’ve talked a lot about Intune, but now it’s time to start getting secure. In this video, we went through the basic steps for getting managed Windows devices onboarded into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

How to onboard Macs to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
------------------------------------------------------

As soon as I started putting up some Mac based videos, there were immediately questions regarding Macs and Defender for Endpoint. It’s going to be a lot more common in 2024 as Defender is a great, unified security tool.

While not as simple to onboard as the PCs, I created an easy to follow guide so you can take an Intune managed Mac and bring it to Defender for Endpoint.

GETRUBIX PODCAST - Episode 4: Microsoft Graph
---------------------------------------------

I’ve been waiting for this one since we started the podcast. Meet [Logan Lautt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-lautt-091b59b8/), an M365 developer on my team, who also happens to be one of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with.

Logan and I chatted about developing for endpoints with the Microsoft Graph API, and shares his views on how to get started.

That’s a wrap
