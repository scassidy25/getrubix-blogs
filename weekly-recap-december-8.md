This week was very exciting, at least for me. The V3 of the migration tool was officially released and we launched our first podcast. What more can you ask for?

Special thanks to Microsoft MVP [Andrew Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-taylor-41707916/) for continuously including this content in his [newsletter](https://andrewstaylor.com/2023/12/08/intune-newsletter-8th-december-2023/). It’s such an awesome privilege to be featured among all of that great Microsoft content.

Thank you, Andrew.

## Matching Identities
---

As much as I prefer to stick to the devices only, I’ve had requests to solve some headaches around associating migrated devices with the correct primary user. Assuming you can work with the team that is also migrating your identities, then hopefully this can help solve for that.

Here is the code snippet I wrote to get an extension attribute from a user and store it in the registry to be retrieved later:

Big thanks to everyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/getrubix) community for all of the testing and feedback that made this version the best yet, and hopefully will just keep getting better.
