This week was very exciting, at least for me. The V3 of the migration tool was officially released and we launched our first podcast. What more can you ask for?

Special thanks to Microsoft MVP [Andrew Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-taylor-41707916/) for continuously including this content in his [newsletter](https://andrewstaylor.com/2023/12/08/intune-newsletter-8th-december-2023/). It’s such an awesome privilege to be featured among all of that great Microsoft content.

Thank you, Andrew.

Matching Identities
-------------------

As much as I prefer to stick to the devices only, I’ve had requests to solve some headaches around associating migrated devices with the correct primary user. Assuming you can work with the team that is also migrating your identities, then hopefully this can help solve for that.

Here is the code snippet I wrote to get an extension attribute from a user and store it in the registry to be retrieved later:

Intune Tenant-to-Tenant Device Migration V3
-------------------------------------------

The V3 officially went live bringing a whole lot of updates you can grab here:

Big thanks to everyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/getrubix) community for all of the testing and feedback that made this version the best yet, and hopefully will just keep getting better.

GETRUBIX PODCAST- Episode 1: Windows 365
----------------------------------------

I’ve been wanting to do this for a very long time, and now it’s finally here. The team I work with is made up of some of the most talented and dedicated technical folks I’ve ever met, and now we’re going to start hearing what they have to say.

For the first episode, [Dustin Gullett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-gullett-83607b1ba/) (Microsoft Solutions Architect) joined me to have a conversation about Windows 365 and all of the real world perspective that comes with it.
